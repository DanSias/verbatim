# How to Set Up a Merchant Account

This article explains how to create and configure a merchant account for payment processing.

## Creating Your Merchant Account

To set up a new merchant account, gather your business documentation before starting. The approval process requires verification of your business identity and banking information.

Steps to create a merchant account:
1. Log into the admin dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings then Merchant Accounts
3. Click Add New Merchant Account
4. Enter your business legal name and tax ID
5. Provide bank account details for receiving settlements
6. Submit for verification

Verification typically completes within two business days. You will receive an email notification when your account is approved.

## Common Setup Issues

Several issues can delay merchant account setup. Review these common problems before contacting support.

Frequent setup problems:
- Tax ID format incorrect: Use the format XX-XXXXXXX
- Bank account verification failed: Confirm routing and account numbers
- Business name mismatch: Legal name must match tax records exactly
- Missing documentation: Upload all required business documents

## After Approval

Once your merchant account is approved, configure your processing preferences before accepting live transactions. Test the integration using sandbox mode first.

Post-approval checklist:
- Set your default currency
- Configure automatic vs manual capture
- Set up webhook notifications
- Process a test transaction in sandbox mode
