# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver real-time notifications about events in your workspace. Configure webhook endpoints to receive HTTP POST requests when specific events occur.

## Setup

Register webhook endpoints through the dashboard or API. Each endpoint requires a valid HTTPS URL and can subscribe to one or more event types.

Supported event types:
- payment.completed: Successful payment processed
- payment.failed: Payment attempt failed
- refund.created: Refund initiated
- chargeback.opened: Chargeback dispute received

## Configuration

Webhook configuration controls delivery behavior and retry logic. Customize settings per endpoint to match your infrastructure requirements.

Configuration options:
- Retry attempts: Number of delivery retries (default: 5)
- Retry interval: Time between retries in seconds
- Timeout: Maximum wait time for response (default: 30 seconds)
- Secret key: HMAC signing key for payload verification

## Verification

Always verify webhook signatures before processing payloads. The platform signs each webhook request using HMAC-SHA256 with your endpoint secret key.

Verification steps:
1. Extract the signature from the X-Webhook-Signature header
2. Compute HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your secret
3. Compare the computed signature with the header value
4. Reject requests with mismatched signatures
