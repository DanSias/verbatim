# Merchant Accounts

Merchant accounts represent the business entities that process payments through the platform. Each merchant account has its own configuration, processing limits, and settlement schedule.

## Setup

To create a new merchant account, use the merchant accounts API endpoint. The setup process requires business verification and may take up to 48 hours for approval.

Required fields for merchant account setup:
- Business legal name
- Tax identification number
- Bank account for settlements
- Business address and contact information

```typescript
const merchant = await client.merchants.create({
  legalName: 'Acme Corporation',
  taxId: '12-3456789',
  bankAccount: {
    routingNumber: '021000021',
    accountNumber: '123456789',
  },
  address: {
    street: '123 Main St',
    city: 'New York',
    state: 'NY',
    postalCode: '10001',
  },
});
```

## Configuration

Each merchant account supports custom configuration options for payment processing behavior. Configuration changes take effect immediately for new transactions.

Configurable options include:
- Default currency for transactions
- Automatic capture vs manual capture
- Fraud detection sensitivity level
- Receipt and notification preferences

## Limits

Merchant accounts have processing limits based on their verification status and history. New accounts start with lower limits that increase over time.

Default processing limits for new accounts:
- Daily transaction volume: $10,000
- Single transaction maximum: $2,500
- Monthly processing cap: $50,000
