# Getting Started

Welcome to the platform documentation. This guide covers the essential concepts for integrating with our payment processing system.

## Overview

The platform provides APIs for processing payments, managing merchant accounts, and handling webhooks. All API requests require authentication using your workspace credentials.

Key features include:
- Payment processing with multiple payment methods
- Merchant account management
- Real-time webhook notifications
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics

## Configuration

Before making API calls, configure your environment with the appropriate base URL and authentication headers. Development and production environments use separate credentials.

Set the following environment variables:
- API_BASE_URL: The base endpoint for all API requests
- API_KEY: Your workspace API key
- WORKSPACE_ID: Your unique workspace identifier

## Limits

Rate limits apply to all API endpoints. The default limit is 1000 requests per minute per workspace. Exceeding this limit results in HTTP 429 responses.

Payload size limits:
- Request body: 10 MB maximum
- Response body: 50 MB maximum
- Batch operations: 100 items per request
